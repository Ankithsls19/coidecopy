Hi Bro,

i need your help to write the best possible apex code now..
a complex scenario this is.

I have an LWC in which on click of a button i form a array like this
[{searchType: 'zipCode', searchValue: '56334', count: 7},
{searchType: 'areaCode', searchValue: '334', count: 4},
{searchType: 'areaCode', searchValue: '544', count: 10},
{searchType: 'zipCode', searchValue: '52384', count: 2}]

so basically the user has addresses and he can select to search the CTNs using zip code or area code.
the array above mentioned created will have grouped the addresses based on zipcode and areacode and the count of addresses in each of them.

i need to call an apex class and pass this array. Need to make api call in it to fetch the numbers.

for the api call,
we can only include 1 zipCode or 1 areaCode. Also the count of Address per call cant be more than 5.
So, lets say for this
{searchType: 'zipCode', searchValue: '56334', count: 7} -> 2 api calls need to be made
with requestBody:
{ "zipCode":"56334", "countOfCTNs" : 5 } and { "zipCode":"56334", "countOfCTNs" : 2 }

For {searchType: 'areaCode', searchValue: '544', count: 10} -> 2 api calls are needed
with requestBody:
{ "areaCode":"544", "countOfCTNs" : 5 } and { "areCode":"544", "countOfCTNs" : 5 }

so help me create the apex classes properly..
like the user can have 25 addresses each having 25 different zipCode and areaCodes, so in the worst case we will have to make 25 api calls.
